# PREDICTING-LIVER-DISEASE

## CONTEXT OF PROBLEM

Liver Disease is referred to any disturbance in the functioning of the liver that causes illness.There are many causes for the liver disease to occur and they mainly include infections, immune system problems, cancer, alcohol abuse, drug overdose, accumulation of too much fat etc.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given a dataset containing biological and logistic data of 583 indian patients, the aim of the project is to identify a suitable machine learning model to verify the presence of liver disease in a patient.
It is a binary classification problem.


## DATASET

The dataset contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records. 

Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90".

This dataset is a multivariate dataset obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 10 attributes -
  * Age
  * Gender
  * Total Bilirubin
  * Direct Bilirubin
  * Alkaline Phosphotase
  * Alamine Aminotransferase
  * Aspartate Aminotransferase
  * Total Proteins
  * Albumin
  * Albumin and Globulin Ratio
  * Dataset: split into 2 sets ( patients with liver disease and without liver disease)
  
 ## MACHINE LEARNING MODELS USED
 
 1. Logistic Regression
 2. Support-Vector Machine
